// ─── How to maintain this file ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every role owns ONE list, all of them collected in ROLE_NAV at the bottom. To
// change a role's sidebar, edit that role's list — nothing else. Order in the
// list is order in the sidebar.
//
// A list holds entries, groups, or both:
//
//   • a bare NavEntry      → one plain row in the sidebar, links straight to the page
//   • a NavGroupEntry      → ONE row in the sidebar (the group's own label + icon)
//                            that opens a hub page of bento tiles, one per item
//
// So a group is never a header with children in the sidebar — it collapses to a
// single clickable row, and its items only appear as tiles on the hub page. This
// is the pattern filipinohomes-final uses for its admin dashboard.
//
// A group with exactly ONE item is pointless as a hub, so it degrades to a
// direct link to that item — no group uses that today, but it means you can add
// a group of one without it becoming a dead one-tile page.
//
// `to` is relative to the role's own dashboard base (`ROLE_DASHBOARD_MAP`), so
// the lists never repeat `/admin` / `/agent` / … and a role's whole subtree can
// be re-slugged in app-roles.ts without touching this file:
//
//   to: ""            → the role's dashboard root      (/agent)
//   to: "listings"    → a page under it                (/agent/listings)
//   to: "/buy"        → left alone (leading slash = absolute, public pages)
//
// A group's own `to` is its hub route and needs a matching folder under
// app/(users)/{role}/ for EVERY role that uses the list (admin + superadmin) —
// a four-line wrapper rendering <HubPage hub="…" />.
//
// ROLE_NAV is a Record<AppRoleId, …>, so adding a role to APP_ROLES is a
// compile error here until you give it a list — no role can silently fall
// through to an empty or wrong sidebar.
