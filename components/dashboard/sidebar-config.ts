// ─── How to maintain this file ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every role owns ONE flat list, all of them collected in ROLE_NAV at the
// bottom. To change a role's sidebar, edit that role's list — nothing else.
// Order in the list is order in the sidebar. There are no section headers: every
// entry renders as a plain icon + label row.
//
// `to` is relative to the role's own dashboard base (`ROLE_DASHBOARD_MAP`), so
// the lists never repeat `/admin` / `/agent` / … and a role's whole subtree can
// be re-slugged in app-roles.ts without touching this file:
//
//   to: ""            → the role's dashboard root      (/agent)
//   to: "listings"    → a page under it                (/agent/listings)
//   to: "/buy"        → left alone (leading slash = absolute, public pages)
//
// ROLE_NAV is a Record<AppRoleId, …>, so adding a role to APP_ROLES is a
// compile error here until you give it a list — no role can silently fall
// through to an empty or wrong sidebar.
